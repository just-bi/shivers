    <h1>Welcome to Shivers!</h1>
    <p>
      Shivers is a utility for SAP/HANA developers to visualize SAP/HANA information views (analytic, attribute and calculation views) and their dependencies.
      The name shivers stands for <b>S</b>ap <b>H</b>ana <b>I</b>nformation <b>V</b>iewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shivers can be run from the local file system. You do not need a webserver.
    </p>
    <p>
      To visualize HANA information views, use the open button on the toolbar.
      Alternatively, drop HANA information vieww source files into the Shivers toolbar.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be prompted to provide the package to which your source files belong. 
      You need to provide the package name yourself because this information cannot be extracted from the files directly.
      Shivers needs to know the package name in order to resolve dependencies on other information views when visualizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After loading information views, shivers will parse the source files and display the loaded objects in the treeview.       
      To visualize any particular information view, simply select one in the treeview by clicking it.
      Shivers will try to evaluate any dependencies as far as it can.
